# ðŸŽ¨ Boost Visual Content Pack ðŸš€

### Repository Overview

This repository contains the **Boost Visual Content Pack**, a project that integrates **artistic techniques** with **technical skills** to produce high-quality, AI-assisted animations. As a **technical artist** specializing in **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **animation**, I developed this solution for personal brands to enhance their online presence through engaging, data-backed visual content.

The project is part of my freelance work, showcasing how I blend traditional art forms, like **rotoscoping**, with modern AI tools to deliver polished animations. The pack not only creates compelling visuals but also tracks and analyzes audience engagement to demonstrate its impact.

### Project Details

The **Boost Visual Content Pack** utilizes a combination of **rotoscoping** and **AI-assisted animation** to produce fluid, high-quality visuals. Here's how the process works:

- **Rotoscoping with Computer Vision**: Instead of hand-drawing every frame, I select keyframes by analyzing motion blur using basic **computer vision techniques** in Python. This allows me to identify the most important frames to focus on.
  
- **Hand-drawn or AI-generated Keyframes**: Once the keyframes are selected, I either hand-draw them or use tools like **ComfyUI** and **Animatediff** to generate them.
  
- **Inbetween Animation with Ebsynth**: The inbetween frames (the frames between keyframes) are automatically generated using **optical flow** with **Ebsynth**, creating smooth transitions while maintaining the hand-crafted look of the keyframes.

- **Audience Analytics**: After the animation is delivered, I provide a detailed report analyzing the project's impact on audience engagement. I track changes in views, likes, and comments by comparing the six videos published before and after the project's release. This helps brands understand the tangible effects of the new content on their social media presence.

### Why This Project Is Part of My Portfolio

As a **technical artist**, this project illustrates my ability to merge traditional animation techniques with modern technology. It demonstrates the use of **computer vision**, **AI**, and **automation** to create content more efficiently without compromising on quality. This project is a prime example of my approach to problem-solving in creative industries, utilizing:

- **Rotoscoping + AI**: A hybrid approach that merges hand-drawn techniques with the power of **AI tools** like ComfyUI and Animatediff, significantly speeding up the animation process while retaining artistic control.
  
- **Optical Flow and Ebsynth**: Automated generation of inbetween frames through **optical flow** calculations, ensuring smooth and consistent transitions between keyframes.

- **Data-Driven Feedback**: Audience analytics to track the performance of the animated content, providing concrete, measurable data on the effects of improved visual engagement.

### Skills Demonstrated

- **Computer Vision (Python)**: Used to detect motion blur and select keyframes for rotoscoping.
- **AI-Assisted Animation**: Integration of tools like **ComfyUI** and **Animatediff** to assist in generating keyframes.
- **Optical Flow (Ebsynth)**: For generating inbetween frames and achieving smooth, cohesive animation.
- **Data Analysis**: Tracking audience behavior and engagement before and after the animation project to show its effectiveness in real-world applications.

### Conclusion

The **Boost Visual Content Pack** is a clear demonstration of my technical and artistic abilities as a freelance **technical artist**. By combining **traditional rotoscoping** with modern **AI tools** and **data analysis**, I offer a unique, efficient approach to creating impactful animations. This project serves as an example of how I apply my skills to deliver meaningful results for clients in the creative industry.
